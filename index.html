				<h3>Opinions and Stories from a Lifelong Dog-Lover</h3>
        <p>By Thomas Gonzalez</p>
				<p>For as long as I can remember, my family has been taking care of dogs of all sorts. Even outside of the ones we directly owned, we'd often take up dogsitting for friends of the family, so trust me when I say I know what it feels like to be in a house full of the little things running around.</p>
        <p>At this point, I can't quite imagine what my life would be like without these dogs with us. I know that people form strong bonds with their pets all the time, but somewhere in my heart it doesn't even feel right to call them pets; they were practically family members themselves.</p>
        <p>I've experienced just about all the ups and downs of familial love with these little guys, and since these domestic animals obviously have shorter lifespans than us, I've experienced many of these emotional rollercoasters in a row. It's exhausting, but the love you share makes it worth it in the end.</p>

        <p>This here is Toby. He was born in 2011, and I believe we got him about a year later when we were living in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>We were taking care of both Toby and another one, Lucho. Toby was always the more hyperactive one of the two, probably because Lucho was the older one. I still remember how much fun he would have outside whenever winter rolled around; we could barely see him in the snow because of his fur.</p>
        <p>When Lucho passed away sometime when I was in middle school (it might've been 2016 or 2017), Toby was alone for a little bit. We eventually adopted a chihuahua named Charlie, but I was irrational with grief from losing Lucho and got mad at my parents because I thought they were trying to replace him. I eventually warmed up to Charlie, and he and Toby spent about 7 more years with us. Just recently in late 2024, Toby's age caught up to him, and it was clear he was in constant pain. We ended up having to put him to sleep in December. Toby had been a part of my life as long as I could remember. I'm never gonna forget him.</p>

		<p>Here's Charlie now. We got him a year or two after we moved to Texas, and he's currently the only dog at our house at the moment.</p>
    <p>He's less hyperactive than Toby was, possibly due to his smaller size. Maybe it's age as well, cuz he doesn't really bark as loud at other dogs or squirrels like he used to. He's still really cute, though. Sometimes, when I need to relax, I get down on the floor wherever he's laying and just rub his head and belly for a while. It calms us both down.</p>
		<p>I was looking at the sample images for this file, particularly the one of the dog running along the beach, and it made me think of how Charlie is with water. Since he's so small he freaks out in the pool, even when we're holding him. I don't think Charlie can swim as well as bigger dogs, and it doesn't help that he's quite old for his size.</p>
    <p>His physical body's also unorthodox. He has this weird neck/spine problem, so his head is always at an angle, and so is his walking. His teeth were also removed because of this infection they got, so now his tongue tends to hang out of his mouth in a little :P face. I feel bad for finding it cute, because now it's hard for him to eat solid food. </p>
